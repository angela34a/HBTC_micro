# HBTC_micro
Code repository for the Master thesis "The impact of groundwater temperature on the composition of groundwater microbial communities in an urban aquifer"

# Data cleaning
.R files with the data cleaning code (combining various sheets and sampling campaigns into one dataset based on unique id) and data preprocessing (removing contaminant ASVs, averaging replicates, designating categories needed for the study) 

# Analysis
.R files with analysis code used in the thesis (alpha/beta microbial diversity, impact of environmental variables on microbiome, and community composition)

The subfolder Donauschotter contains a subset of data and analysis performed on it.
